                <h2>Not really a recipe web page</h2>
                <p>This page is the final assignment in the CSS Foundations section of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">The Odin Project Foundations course</a>.</p>
                <p>The mission consists of styling a recipe page created in the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations">HTML Foundations section</a>. It wasn't very glamorous then, and it's not particularly flashy now, but it gave me a chance to review concepts and try stuff out.</p>
                <p>I chose a mix of classic chicken recipes: 
                <ul>
                    <li>A wholesome soup that cures colds, unbreaks hearts, warms the chest, and sells books.</li>
                    <li>A classic, both French and Russian, that no one knows the right spelling for. Ask a Stroganov if you see one.</li>
                    <li>One that made the list because my partner and I cooked it on our first-date.</li>
                    <li>One that is not a typo, but a tribute to Taylor Swift's favorite recipe, taught to me by my 15-year-old Swiftie.</li>
                </ul> 
                </p>I didn't write out the actual recipes I use for these dishes, or take real pictures. So you'll just have to trust me when I say mine look a bit better than these photos, and I can surely style chicken better than recipe pages.</p>
                <p>Anyways, here they are:</p>

                    <p>Anyone who ever tried it knows that approaching The Odin Project is surely a brave endeavor. Yet, strangely enough, all the recipes in this project involve chicken. In the wise words of Alanis Morrissette:
