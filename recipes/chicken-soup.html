    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marry Me Chicken Soup is the <strong>favorite cozy recipe</strong> of creamy, tangy chicken in stew form with rich flavors of sun-dried tomato, onion, garlic, chicken, cheese, and more.
          And it's the ideal bowl to <strong>tuck into on a quiet night at home</strong> with your special someone. The saying stands true: The way to the heart is through the stomach.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sun-dried tomatoes:</strong>Julienne-cut sun-dried tomatoes in oil with herbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong>Onion, garlic, and tomato paste round out the rest of the flavor base.</li>
            <li><strong>Broth:</strong>Chicken broth and heavy cream combine to create a rich liquid.</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta:</strong>Medium shell pasta is cooked right in the soup.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong>Julienne-like cut leftover roasted chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong>Bring balance to the soup with basil, red pepper flakes, spinach, cream cheese, and Parmesan.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by sautéing the onion and garlic in the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Then add in the tomatoes and tomato paste before pouring in broth, cream, and seasonings.</li>
            <li>Simmer this base together before adding the dried pasta to cook directly in the soup until al dente.</li>
            <li>Spinach and shredded rotisserie chicken go in toward the end to warm through.</li>
            <li>Add the cream cheese, Parmesan, and final garnishes for big spoonfuls of delicious flavor. </li>
