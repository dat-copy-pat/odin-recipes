    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken strogonoff is a delicious and comforting dish perfect for a cozy night in.
        I wondered why some people call it <em>Stroganoff</em>, until I learned the dish, originated in Russia in the mid-19th century,
         was named after the very wealthy <em>Stroganov</em> family, which explains those, and possibly other spellings for this delicious dish.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken, duh:</strong>Just 2 chicken breasts, cubed into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong>A mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Condiments:</strong>Worcestershire sauce & Dijon mustard are ideal to bring tartness and heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Sour cream:</strong>Use full-fat sour cream for the richest flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>These two round out the sauce flavor perfectly.</li>
            <li><strong>Mushrooms:</strong>Cremini, button or portobello will do, just slice in small pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Thyme:</strong>Thyme needs no explanation. Just add and enjoy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with seasoning powder, and then toss to coat evenly.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil. Add chicken and cook for 2-3 minutes per side. 
                Leave it to brown and sear on one side before turning the pieces. Once cooked, transfer to a plate. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add butter to a hot pan, add the onion and mushrooms and sauté for 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the pan and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until everything is hot.</li>
            <li>Stir in the sour cream, then remove from the heat before the sauce starts to bubble, which can cause the sour cream to curdle.</li>
            <li>Season with additional salt and pepper, then serve with mashed potatoes or rice.</li>
        </ol>
