The Odin Project Foundations Project: Recipes

The project is an assigment for the Foundations Course from The Odin Project.

**1.**
Create a website with a main index page with links to recipes. 
The assignment only involves HTML practice so it will not look nice. 
The project will be revisited later to add styling with CSS.

**2.**
Add styling with CSS using external CSS.
Practice with color & typography properties, box model etc. 

"Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don’t worry at all about making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume".
