The Odin Project Foundations Project: Recipes

The project is an assigment for the Foundations Course from The Odin Project.

The assignment is to create a website with a main index page with links to recipes. 
The assignment only involves HTML practice so it will not look nice. 
The project will be revisited later to add styling with CSS.
